### Beta v1.2.8.2 (23rd August, 2022)
 
**Tweaks**
- Adjusted parameters in the C.F.O. boss battle to make removing safes off the C.F.O.'s head easier.
- To address server stability concerns, all Doodles now have Neutral mood, and will not change moods in-game.
  - As a side effect of this change, accuracy of Doodle tricks in battle have been increased across the board.
  - Please read [the blog post](https://corporateclash.net/news/article/95) on why we're doing this, and our plans with Doodles going forward.

- Fixed a bug where a door related to the Blizzard Wizard would not unlock correctly after finishing a ToonTask.
- For Content Pack Creators: Fixed an issue where the Overclocked Find The Foreman's music.json definition was listed twice.
