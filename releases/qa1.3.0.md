### Beta v1.3.0, QA #1 (September 2nd, 2022)
 
These patch notes are for our initial Partner QA session. They have been stripped down from the complete v1.3.0 Patch Notes, and include only what is present in the QA sessions.
 
**Social Panel**
- The Social Panel is a brand new interface to replace the old Friends List!
- The Friends List icon has been remade.
- The Social Panel is broken up into three tabs: the Friends Tab, the Groups Tab, and the Clubs Tab.
- Friends Tab
  - The Friends Tab boasts the new and completely overhauled Friends List!
  - While similar old functionality remains, there are several new improvements that are worth noting.
  - There are there sections for filtering Toons in the Friends List: Nearby Toons, Online Friends, and All Friends.
    - When you are in a Club, you can even view Online Clubmates and All Clubmates!
  - You can now enter a configuration mode, which will empower you to make massive edits or other quick configurations to specific friends!
    - While in configuration mode, you can quickly view a Toon's stats, send them a whisper, invite them to your Club/Group, and more!
    - You can even select multiple toons, and send whispers to all of them! Mass friend removal is also supported.
    - You can now promote your friends to be Favorite Friends, which gives them a distinct appearance amongst all your friends.
- Groups Tab
  - The Groups Tab holds an in-game Group Tracker, connecting you to be able to join Groups from anywhere in-game!
  - Groups are discussed in detail further below.
- Clubs Tab
  - The Clubs Tab holds a ton of information about your Club, such as active boosters, current Club Task, member list, club history, and more!
  - Clubs are discussed in detail further below.
 
**Notification Panel**
- Most in-game notifications now route themselves to an exclusive dropdown menu that appears alongside the Social Panel.
- The Notification Panel is designed to help organize these notifications, reducing the screen space that they take up.
- The following types of notifications have been reworked to use the new Notification Panel:
  - New Cattlelogs and Deliveries
  - Friend Requests
- In addition, you'll be seeing these use the Notification Panel as well:
  - Group Invites
  - Club Invites
  - Group Status Updates
  - Group Join Responses
  - Club Jellybean Donation
  - Club Task Purchase
  - Club Task Rerolls
 
**Groups**
- Boarding Groups have been deprecated in favor of a brand-new, in-game Group Tracker!
  - This new Group Tracker is built into the new Social Panel.
- You can join Groups anywhere in-game, cross-district.
- You can make groups if you are in the relevant area (i.e. standing around a Cog Building will allow you to create Cog Building groups).
- You can only join Groups that are available to you (i.e. you cannot join C.E.O. groups if you do not have your Bossbot Cog Disguise and sufficient merits).
- Upon joining or creating a Group, you can enter a chat exclusive to that Group by clicking the wing that appears on the Chatbox.
- Extensive options have been provided for group filtering!
  - By default, you can only see the groups that you can currently join. You can change the setting to view all available groups.
  - You can also filter by different group types or by location.
- We expect this feature to have a major impact on how Toontown: Corporate Clash is played. If you have any suggestions for the system, community suggestions can be submitted in our public Discord server!
 
**Clubs**

- Once you're in a Club, you'll be bestowed a Club Nametag bearing the name of the Club.

**Chatbox**
- We have completely overhauled and rebuilt the game's chat system from the ground up!
  - The Chatlog has been replaced with a modernized Chatbox!
  - This change combines the Chatlog and type-chat entries into a single GUI piece.
- You can now filter chat by various categories (Whispers, Alerts, and NPC).
- When you are in a Group, an exclusive wing tab will open, allowing you to communicate to all members of that Group.
- When you are in a Club, you can use the Club Tab to freely speak to all online members of your Club.
- When you are in battle, an exclusive wing tab will open, filtering all messages from other Toons in your battle for easier communication.
- Unites have been moved out of the Speedchat menu and into their own exclusive dropdown.
- Whispers can now be sent to up to four separate Toons simultaneously.
  - Group whispers are sent individually to each person.
- The Options page provides several useful focus modes for the Chatbox.
  - By default, the chat focus mode is Always Shown, which shows the full Chatbox when it is open.
  - When set to Transparent, the Chatbox elements will be transparent. The amount of transparency can be adjusted.
  - When set to Minimal, the majority of the Chatbox will become fully invisible, and the background for chat messages can have its transparency adjusted.
    - Hovering over the Chatbox in both Transparent and Minimal focus modes will fully reveal it.
- The size of the Chatbox and the visible line count can be tweaked in the Options.
- Meet the paragon of social interaction: Stickers!
  - Stickers are a brand new way to express your emotions to nearby Toons that can be used similarly to Emotes.
  - By using a sticker, your Toon will hold out the exact expression in their hand to show off to the world!
  - We've provided a default suite of 16 stickers.
- We have also rebuilt our command system to empower players with their own suite of chat commands!
  - By pressing slash, a dropdown menu will open for relevant chat commands.
  - Full autocompletion and command argument suggestions have been implemented.
  - Below is a complete list of all of the new Shortcuts, available to our QA Testers:
    - /whisper {friend}: Sets a whisper target on a currently online friend. Aliases: /msg, /dm
    - /emote {emotion}: Plays a Toon emote.
    - /friend {toon}: Sends a friend request to a Toon.
    - /home: Teleports you to your estate. Aliases: /estate

  - We plan on adding more by the release of v1.3.0.
 
**Battles**
- Several major parts of the battle system have been rewritten from the ground up, including massive architectural redesigns of our Battle Calculator!
- These changes are made to allow more versatility in designing battles, while also making them easier to develop.
  - Yes, as it turns out we, once again, have refactored several major parts of the battle system. Shocker.
- The battle system now supports movie cutscenes and events, along with environmental effects and direct manipulation of the fourth dimension.

**Gags**
As discussed in a recent blogpost, we have made several massive changes to various Gag Tracks. Since then, we've been listening to community feedback and have been having conversations with our Partner and Community Testers in order to refine some of the Gag changes even further. As such, you will see a few new additions and changes made here that were not present in the original blog post.
 
Here are the general changes that we have made relative to the original Gag Balancing blogpost:
- Tweaked some Toon-Up healing values.
- Added a new debuff to Trap.
- Removed the conditional requirement for Trap's prestige.
- Lure Knockback now adds to the Gag's combo damage.
- Big Magnet, Hypno Goggles, and Presentation have been given +5 knockback.
- Prestige Lure now affects group Lure more than single Lure.
- Completely reworked the Squirt prestige.
- Tweaked the jump damage pool for Zap from 80% unpres/100% pres to be 90% unpres/110% pres.
- Tweaked the base damage of Zap.
- Removed the 90% accuracy cap of Drop.
- Increased the base damage of Drop.
- Increased the combo damage of Drop.
- IOUs now give the boost to both you and your target.
- Slightly tweaked the values of Lure IOUs.
 
- Completely overhauled the Gag Training page GUI to make it easier and more comfortable to use.
- The Gag EXP requirements have been adjusted across the board, the requirements below reflect all requirements from getting to Level 2 to maxing your Gag Tracks.
  - 20/100/500/2000/5000/9000/14000/20000
- Toon-Up
  - Lowered the self heal from prestige Toon-Up to 40%.
  - Increased the base heal from a missed Toon-Up Gag to 40%.
  - Heal values:
    - Bamboo Cane: 39 -> 45 Laff
    - Pixie Dust: 50 -> 60 Laff
    - Juggling Cubes: 78 -> 84 Laff
    - Confetti Cannon: 95 -> 90 Laff
  - Self-Heal from prestige Toon-Up will now show when the Toon in question is healed, rather than at the beginning of the battle movie.
  - Fixed various animation issues with Feather, Lipstick, and High-Dive.
  - After the Toon-Up animation finishes, the chat will no longer be cleared.
- Trap
  - A new debuff is inflicted upon a Trap's activation: Dazed!
    - Similar to Soaked, Dazed provides a 10% dodge chance decrease to the affected Cog.
    - This debuff lasts for two rounds (the round of application and the round after).
  - Removed the conditional requirement for Trap's prestige.
  - The shoes now fly off of Cogs when they are destroyed by a Wrecking Ball.
  - Tweaked the grow and shrink animations for various Trap props.
- Lure
  - Lure Gags now feature a flat knockback damage per gag, rather than a knockback percentage.
  - The knockback damage that the Lure provides is added to the base damage of every Throw or Squirt Gag used on the Cog.
    - Consequentially, this increases the amount of combo damage dealt.
    - For example, if two Throw Gags are used on a Cog that is lured for 40 Knockback damage, they will take 80 total Knockback damage, and will take more combo damage.
  - Prestige Lure now increases the knockback damage of single target Lure Gags by 15%, and group target Lure Gags by 25%.
  - Lure Gags have also had their accuracy adjusted, offering more incentive to use single-target Gags over always favoring group target Gags.
  - Lowered the rounds of each Lure Gag by 1.
  - Lure decay has been entirely removed.
  - Knockback values:
    - $1 Bill: 5 Knockback, 70% accuracy, 2 rounds
    - Small Magnet: 10 Knockback, 60% accuracy, 2 rounds
    - $5 Bill: 15 Knockback, 75% accuracy, 3 rounds
    - Big Magnet: 30 Knockback, 65% accuracy, 3 rounds
    - $10 Bill: 55 Knockback, 80% accuracy, 4 rounds
    - Hypno Goggles: 45 Knockback, 70% accuracy, 4 rounds
    - $50 Bill: 100 Knockback, 85% accuracy, 5 rounds
    - Presentation: 75 Knockback, 75% accuracy, 5 rounds
- Sound
  - The base damage of Sound Gags has been increased.
  - Sound Gags no longer have combo damage when multiple are used in a turn.
  - Damage values:
    - Kazoo: 4 -> 5 damage
    - Bike Horn: 7 -> 10 damage
    - Whistle: 11 -> 16 damage
    - Bugle: 16 -> 23 damage
    - Aoogah: 21 -> 30 damage
    - Elephant Trunk: 32 -> 50 damage
    - Foghorn: 50 -> 70 damage
    - Opera Singer: 65 -> 90 damage
  - Introducing Sound's new prestige effect: Encore!
    - Whenever a prestige Sound Gag is used, the Toon who used the Gag will get 10% increased damage to non-Sound Gags for the next turn.
    - Prestige Sound no longer increases the damage of Sound Gags.
  - Instead of disappearing, the Sound gag megaphone will now shrink after usage during battle movies.
  - Fixed a longstanding issue where the camera angles for the Fog Horn and Opera Singer gags were swapped.
- Squirt
  - Instead of soaking multiple Cogs, prestige Squirt now provides a new debuff: Drenched!
    - Drenched is a more potent version of Soaked, providing some better benefits.
    - Drenched Cogs have a 20% dodge chance decrease.
    - Drenched Cogs will deal 15% less damage.
    - Zap Gags will only remove a single round of Drenched on use.
    - Drenched is applied only to the Cog targeted by the Squirt Gag used.
  - By default, every other Squirt Gag (levels 2, 4, 6, and 8) now soak 3 Cogs.
  - The other Squirt Gags (levels 1, 3, 5, 7) now do increased damage to make up for their lack of triple soak.
  - Damage values:
    - Squirting Flower: 4 -> 5 damage, soaks 1 Cog.
    - Glass of Water: 8 damage, soaks 3 Cogs.
    - Squirt Gun: 12 -> 16 damage, soaks 1 Cog.
    - Water Balloon: 21 damage, soaks 3 Cogs.
    - Seltzer Bottle: 30 -> 40 damage, soaks 1 Cog.
    - Firehose: 56 damage, soaks 3 Cogs.
    - Storm Cloud: 80 -> 95 damage, soaks 1 Cog.
    - Geyser: 115 damage, soaks 3 Cogs.
  - The Firehose's water stream now follows the Cog as it is being attacked during battle movies.
- Zap
  - Zap's jump damage now acts as a "pool" of damage.
    - This damage pool is split between the Cogs which it jumps onto.
    - This damage pool is 90% of the damage of the Zap gag used.
  - The nature of Zap's jump targeting has been greatly simplified.
    - There are now only two ways that Zap can deal damage across three soaked Cogs: Xxx and xxX.
      - The capital X represents the Cog that has been targeted directly by the Zap gag.
      - The lowercase x reflects the Cog targeted by Zap jumps. Jump damage is split between all of these cogs.
      - Zap will prioritize jumping to soaked cogs to the left if possible. If not, it will go right.
    - As a consequence, the following has changed:
      - Zap can no longer switch directions while jumping.
      - Zap Gags can now target Cogs which have been jumped to by a previous Zap Gag, rather than jumping over them.
      - Zap Gags will now damage Cogs killed by other Zaps in the same turn.
      - Zap can no longer jump over cleared sets of Cogs in general (i.e. no more X-x). The soaked Cogs must be adjacent.
      - Some double Zap combos become infeasible for defeating full sets of Cogs (such as X-X-), while others are now more feasible (such as X--X, or --XX).
      - Zap damage falloff has been reworked.
      - The soaked cog bonus of 3x damage is now 1x damage (as the base damage now has the damage boost accounted for).
  - Zap gags now have 0% accuracy against unsoaked cogs.
  - Prestige Zap now increases the total jump damage from 90% base damage to 110% base damage.
  - Using Zap on a soaked Cog now removes the soak, instead of reducing its duration by one round.
  - The Gag Shop has decided to replace the Balloon and Taser gags with some Toonier alternatives: Lightbulb and Broken Radio!
    - In addition, the Gag order has been slightly altered, with the level 4 and 5 Gags having swapped places.
  - Soaked Zap damage has been adjusted, as follows:
    - Level 2: 18 -> 22 damage
    - Level 3: 30 -> 40 damage

**IOUs**
- SOS Cards have been rebranded entirely to become IOUs!
- IOUs are single-target, high-power stack-based Gag effectiveness buffs.
- If an IOU is used on another Toon, the Toon who used it will also profit from the boost provided, given that they have access to the Gag track in question.
  - Using an IOU on yourself will only provide the base effects of the IOU.
- IOUs work on a "stack" system, giving buffs to the next few Gags rather than giving a buff for the next few rounds.
- IOU values:
  - Toon-Up:
    - Madam Chuckle: +35 Toon-Up to the next 3 Toon-Up Gags.
    - Daffy Don: +45 Toon-Up to the next 2 Toon-Up Gags.

    - Nancy Gas: +20 Knockback damage to the next 2 Lure Gags.

    - Franz Neckvein: +75 damage to the next 2 Drop Gags.
    - Barnacle Bessie: +150 damage to the next Drop Gag.
  - Rain:
    - +20 damage to the next Gag.
    - Rain's IOU has been removed from the Derrick Man and is now given as a constant extra reward from each completed V.P. battle.
- These changes have been made to make using these rewards feel more impactful, and allow users to use the full value of the reward. Rather than potentially missing some of the value by using another Gag track, or by missing their Gags, players will now be able to consistently take full advantage of these rewards.
- Former SOS card types not listed (such as Restock All, Cogs Damage Down, and Toons Accuracy Up) have been removed.
  - If you own any of these SOS cards, they will be rerolled into one of the aforementioned IOUs from this list.
 
**Unites**
- Single Gag-Up unites now restock up to level 8 gags.
  - However, the amount of Gags that these unites restock has been decreased to 6, so be careful with how you use them!
- The unite cooldown of Gag-Up unites has been increased by 1 round.
 
**Cease and Desists**
- C&Ds will no longer be refreshed to their maximum rounds upon being hit with a Gag. Instead, the rounds will be incremented by one (1) for each Gag used.
