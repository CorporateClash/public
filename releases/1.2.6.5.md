### Beta v1.2.6.5 (14th Mar, 2022)
 
**Optimizations**
- We've made some optimizations to the game!
  - The Wardrobe and the main menu should now load much faster thanks to model loading optimizations.
  - The code responsible for synchronizing the player's animation to their movement speed has been sped up by roughly 20x.
  - Camera collisions have received further optimizations.
- Overall, players should notice decent performance improvements throughout the game, especially on lower-end computers.
  
**Tweaks**
- The cost to re-roll a Daily Task reward has been reduced from 5000 Jellybeans to 2500 Jellybeans.
- The C.F.O. will no longer unstun if a Toon walks into him when he is stunned.
- Toon Panels will now update their Laff Points as they change.

- Fixed the "Taunts" SpeedChat category's location as it was erroneously moved out of the "Battle" category.
- Fixed a major issue with the Battle GUI randomly jumping back to the gag select menu.
- Potentially fixed a crash in regards to attempting to update the game resolution on macOS.
